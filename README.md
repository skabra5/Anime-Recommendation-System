# Anime-Recommendation-System
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/natlee/myanimelist-comment-dataset

I used Pyspark to build a collaborative filtering recommendation system using matrix factorization by applying two algorithms: Alternate Least Squares and K-nearest Neighbor. Additionally, I incorporated a module using TFIDF features of the reviews to provide recommendations based on user specified queries like “I want to watch an action movie”.
